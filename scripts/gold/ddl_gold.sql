DDL Script: Create Gold Views
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script creates the views that make up the Gold layer of the data warehouse.
    The Gold layer provides the final analytical model, consisting of dimension and fact views organized using a star schema.

    Each view performs transformations and combines data from the Silver layer 
    to produce a clean, enriched, and business-ready dataset.

Usage:
    - These views can be queried directly for analytics and reporting.
